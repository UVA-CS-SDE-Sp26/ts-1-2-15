Program control: connecting the command line to the file handler (request file contents and return readable text)
- no args: provide list of files available (team member B) and corresponding number
    ex: input ->  java topsecret
        output -> 01 filea.txt
                  02 fileb.txt
                  03 filec.txt
- one arg: display content of file
    ex: input ->  java topsecret 01
        output -> (content of filea.txt)
- two args: specifies an alternate key to use when deciphering (none = just use default key)


Plan:


Tests:
- no args
    expected output: 01 filea.txt
                     02 fileb.txt
                     03 filec.txt
- one arg: 02
    expected output: (content of fileb.txt)
- one arg # out of bound: 5
    expected output: file not found
- one arg random string: filez
    expected output: file not found
- 2 args
