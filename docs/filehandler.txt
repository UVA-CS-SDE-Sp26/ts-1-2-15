Requirements for filehandler:
1. Exit gracefully if a file is not found.
2. Exit gracefully if a file is not deciphered.
3. Files are not directly accessed outside of the filehandler.
4. Every method has at least one test.  
5. Return a file's content when a request is recieved. 

Rough Plan:

Only arguement should be file name.
If (insert file name) then 
return (file contents)
else 
return (file not found!)

Also have it so that when no argument is given it lists all available files. 

Tests that could be run:
1. Test a file name that doesn't exist.
2. Test each file name that does exist.
3. Test no argument given.
