Requirements for filehandler:
1. Exit gracefully if a file is not found.
2. Exit gracefully if a file is not deciphered.
3. Files are not directly accessed outside of the filehandler.
4. Every method has at least one test.  
5. Return a file's content when a request is recieved. 

Rough Plan:

Only arguement should be file name.
If (insert file name) then 
return (file contents)
else 
return (file not found!)

Also have it so that when no argument is given it lists all available files. 

This will need to be two seperate methods that are then called by Team Member C. 

Tests that could be run:
1. Test a file name that doesn't exist.
2. Test every file name that does exist. (feasible tests in this case as only two example files are given)
3. Test no argument given.
